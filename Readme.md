# React App using Flux Architecture
Here, we want to implement Flight search functionality. We have a form, where user can input and search for the flights. Then user will be able to see the search results, user can refine the search using a slider for prices.

## Key functionalities
- Search for one way and return flights  
- Search for the flights based on price range  

### To setup the project
- npm install

### To run the project
- npm start (webpack automatically listens for the changes made in the file)

### To run the test cases
- npm run test (unit tests have been written for some parts only)

Note : The app has a lot of bugs and sometimes not works.

#### Detailed desc of implementation
- In the search and price-range component, front end validation has been put. Search will only happen if fields have been filled correctly, otherwise error will show.
- Flight search is done on dummy data stored in data.js under src/constants/ folder. The dummy data is generated by a python script named as data_generator.py located in src/constants
- Unit test have been done for the components using snapshot testing in Jest framework.
- Each time unit test will run, code coverage report will be generated and shown
- The right top menu showing the itinerary changes depending up the query in search box
- The search results will be shown in 2 columns depending upon one way or return search
- Snapshots are added for further reference
