# React App using Flux Architecture
Here, we want to implement Flight search functionality. We have a form, where user can input and search for the flights. Then user will be able to see the search results, user can refine the search using a slider for prices.

## Key functionalities
- Search for one way and return flights  
- Search for the flights based on price range  

### To setup the project
- npm install

### To run the project
- npm start (webpack automatically listens for the changes made in the file)

### To run the test cases
- under progress

Note : Flight search is done on dummy data stored in data.js under src/constants/ folder
